You can get data from Kaggle - Titanic 

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Data Loading and Exploration
The dataset is loaded and initial exploration is performed to understand the structure and contents of the data. This includes checking for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to identify patterns and relationships in the data. Various visualizations are created to understand the distribution of features and their impact on survival.

## Model Building
Several machine learning models are implemented to predict survival, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of findings and potential improvements for future work.
